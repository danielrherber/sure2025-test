Fort Collins Intelligent Traffic Light System

Project Overview:

The purpose of this Traffic Light Control System model is to optimize traffic flow and enhance safety in Fort Collins through intelligent traffic signals and real-time monitoring. The system will evaluate the impact of adding a preemptive system for emergency vehicles, assessing how it improves response times and intersection efficiency. The scope of this project covers the entire Fort Collins traffic network, including a centralized Traffic Management Center (TMC), vehicle sensors, pedestrian signals, and fiber-optic communication systems. A major aspect of the model is evaluating the effect of a preemptive system on emergency vehicle prioritization, allowing for the seamless integration of emergency vehicle passage through intersections.
